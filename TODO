* Increase cb-ctl --build-log to fetch prepare and build log at once

* complete add tests (100%)

* Issue: release number across runners.
  If a package is build on one runner the release starts at 1 and
  increases. If the package is picked up by another runner it will
  use the release state of this runner which can be 1 or >1 if
  that package has been built by that runner in the past.
  Thus the release number is non deterministic at the moment.
  No good solution so far, don't want to interconnect services

* Create images for the cloud (Amazon)
  Having images available could simplify the setup of the build
  cluster. There should be images for:
  - runner(cb-scheduler/cb-prepare/cb-run/cb-info)
  - fetcher/control-plane(cb-fetch/cb-ctl)
  - solver(cb-depsolve)
  Also required is a running and accessible kafka broker.
  ==> The system should scale with more runner
